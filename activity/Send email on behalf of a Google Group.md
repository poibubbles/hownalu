## Configuring your Google Group

1. Go to [groups.google.com](https://groups.google.com/) and log in with your Lafayette credentials.
2. Click the name of your Google Group and click **Group settings** from the bottom-left.
3. If not already set, temporarily set **Who can post** to **Anyone on the web**. This setting will allow Google to send a confirmation email later when configuring to send from the Google Group address in Gmail.

## Configuring Gmail to send from your Google Group

1. Go to [Gmail](https://mail.google.com/a/lafayette.edu) and log in with your Lafayette credentials.
2. Click the **gear icon** in the upper-right and then click **See all settings**.
3. Click **Accounts** and click **Add another email address** in the “Send mail as” section.
4. Enter the email address of your Google Group, leave **Treat as an alias** checked, and click **Next step**.
5. Click the **Send Verification** button to receive an email confirmation. This message will go to the Google Group.
6. Close the window.
7. Return to your [Google Group](https://groups.google.com/) (or your Gmail inbox if your Google Group subscription is set to email you) to click the verification link. Click the **Confirm** button when prompted.
8. Now when sending new messages from your Gmail account, you can select either your Gmail account or your Google Group email address as the sender in the From field.
9. So others from the Google Group can’t configure their Gmail accounts to send from the Google Group address, change the Google Group setting **Who can post** from **Anyone on the web** back to the previous setting.
