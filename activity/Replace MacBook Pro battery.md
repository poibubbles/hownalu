Case screws are pentablobe, inside screws are Torx.

Battery connector cables looked like some were frayed, wires exposed.

Touchpad cable didn't fit back nicely in, tried pushing, gave up.
Some leftover slack in the line.

Retaining flap on right fan ribbon cable came off. Looked intact, but
wasn't gonna reassemble/replace it in the socket in this lifetime.

Right fan didn't move well, got a little stuck in places during
rotation, didn't take much effort to rotate it past those places.
Spun for a while, unscrewed housing, eventually spun OK.

The steel wool stuff by the two firebolt connectors came off.

Junk that the batter connector gets reattatched at the end of the assembly
and the trackpad at the beginning - hopefully they line up. :)

Charge light took a while (minute or two) to turn on (red).

On startup, display show backlight but no logo or bar.

Display out to HDMI works.

Boot hangs on logo for about 20min (bar at ~1/4) until restarts on its own. 
After this restart, HDMI display is darkened and bar pauses at ~1/20.

Recovery mode
disk repair works OK for all possible disk selections
wifi works
remote install fails with a cert error
select boot disk works, takes to login screen, but
..login screen frozen after changing resolution - probably because when I got past the login screen successfully I selected "optimize for Retina" display instead of the HDMI display it had detected (and successfully used). So now no laptop or HDMI (unless on HDMI in recovery mode).
