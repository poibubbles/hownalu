Create or edit [[Google Sites]] in the shared [website folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1gSL_p5Hq6AwA_FK-xUBZ-ivdin61lQ1Q).

Make the published site public.

Leave the `Web address` value of the published site the same as the site name.

Note the URL *below* the `Web address` (ex. https://sites.google.com/aonalu.net/aonalu) and use that as the basis for a custom URL configured in the workspace admin console [workspace admin console](https://admin.google.com/ac/apps/sites/address)(ex. `sites.google.com/aonalu.net/aonalu`).
