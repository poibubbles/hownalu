Google will serve web content for a naked domain (`mydomain.com`) by redirecting content from a subdomain (`www.mydomain.com`).

The method to set up the naked domain's redirection is at: https://support.google.com/a/answer/2518373. Setting up the subdomain that the redirection points to is covered here: [[Serve a Workspace Site on a subdomain]].

For related information and more options, such as [[Google Domains]]' Synthetic records and `http`/`https` redirections, see: https://support.google.com/a/thread/208207724?hl=en&msgid=208217505
