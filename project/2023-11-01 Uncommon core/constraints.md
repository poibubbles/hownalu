The more participants are aware and attentive, the better chance for success in the short run.
The longer participants are aware and attentive, the better the results in the long run.
The more integrated the activities, the better their collective results.
The more integrated the participants are in an activity, the better their collective results.

Participants will come and go. Activities should anticipate this for the short run. Expectations should anticipate this for the long run.

4 sessions per day (broadly):
1. pre-lunch math
2. pre-lunch language
4. post-lunch music
5. post-lunch art/physical activity
Pre- and post-lunch to accommodate half-day instructor shifts. Pre-lunch shifts are primarily academic/imaginative, post-lunch shifts are primarily physical/perfunctory.

Ideally:
* Math and language instructors can handle both math and language for econ/HR purposes, though math should precede language.
* Music and art/physical activity instructors can handle both music and art/physical activity for econ/HR purposes, though any physical exertion should *really* have an hour's worth of rest after lunch (hence, music first).

Language:
* Foreign language is handled during math and language. Sign language counts as foreign (see below).
* Local language and culture is handled during music and art/physical activity.
* Sign language for littles.....

Determine:
* skill progressions and dependencies
* skill competency determination
* minimum competency for participation in a given activity
* activities to accommodate self-directed advancement

Progressions:
* Arithmetic > Algebra > Linear Algebra > Statistics
* Song > Reading
* Song > Writing
* Judo | Yoga | Lifts
* Ukulele levels: backup, solo, session
* ...
