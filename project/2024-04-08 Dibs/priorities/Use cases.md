For insurance claims. What are the norms for evidence. www.aipnw.com 

Items age, condition (good, fair, poor, etc), cost to replace.

Use local artist performance as use case. Who, when, where, how much, what conditions/environment (indoor, grass, drink minimum, dress code, etc.), etc.. Rank inter dimensionally (price more important than place) and intra dimensionally (this zip code better than that region or venue). Filter and prioritize notifications based on ranking. Include asset/resource type as filter (performance, good, service). Also subscribe by artist/source/provider, venue/host, promoter/organization/club. Hopefully making subscriptions nicer and easier so someone feels OK subscribing to a gazillion sources because they’re only gonna receive info on the products they want according to their filters. Presentation wise, front page is most recent best, swipe to get good hits, then swipe for aight hits.

References and citations.

Objects that have many to many relations.

What does sharing imply with respect to deletion. Copy? capability? And updatable copy? Or if we called him a draft then we can say notify upon new draft? Or latest draft? We do not want some thing that cannot be deleted.

The benefit of using explicit links or relations over relying on indexed fields is that the thing being linked to or referenced can be introspective to figure out how it was being used. for example a date may be when something starts or when something stops. If you wanted to know what stopped or started on a particular day you would have to know in advance that you need to search for the date and start and stop fields. But if the date itself was referenced then you could start at that date object and go backwards to figure out how it was used.

Overlap dibs with baby steps in terms of having results and outcomes as baby steps be something that you can want or deliver as dibs.

Would be nice to be able to fire off external calls as triggers that were indebted inside a capability. That way you could have a generic capability that says send notification to everybody who can see this collection when somebody add something to the collection.

Or we just say that side effects and push notifications are things that are handled outside the database.

Could at least add a notify or subscribe field tool capability or collection along with a notification or change log element so that there could be a running list of changes That people could at least ask for recent updates about..
