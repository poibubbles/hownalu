Latest from `brew` update:

	sphinx-doc is keg-only, which means it was not symlinked into /usr/local,
	because this formula is mainly used internally by other formulae.
	Users are advised to use `pip` to install sphinx-doc.

	If you need to have sphinx-doc first in your PATH, run:
	  echo 'export PATH="/usr/local/opt/sphinx-doc/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.zshrc
