The issue was on a Red Hat VM ([[2024-12-03 tsc hpet acpi_pm clocksource issues on RedHat 9.5]]).

## Orientation

From `/boot/grub2/grub.cfg`:

	# DO NOT EDIT THIS FILE
	# It is automatically generated by grub2-mkconfig using templates
	# from /etc/grub.d and settings from /etc/default/grub

Apparently `grub2-mkconfig` concatenates snippets from `/etc/grub.d/*` using
variables from `/boot/grub2/grubenv` in order to populate `grub.cfg`. So looks
like gotta just read `grub.cfg` to get a sense of how variables from `grubenv`
are used.

? Why use grubenv over /etc/default/grub?

Arguably (as of 2012), go ahead and use `/etc/grub.d/99_local`:

From
https://discussion.fedoraproject.org/t/using-grubby-to-set-grub-default/129955/3:
*Using grubby takes care of all that is needed (including the changes to
/etc/default/grub) and most frequently only applies when making changes to
kernel boot options. Grubby makes changes to /boot/grub2/grub.cfg,
/etc/kernel/cmdline, /etc/default/grub, the applicable .conf file(s) in
/boot/loader/entries/, and does other updates as well."*

## Failures

Trying..:
*  GRUB_HIDDEN_TIMEOUT_QUIET

Tried..:

* using `qemu-system-x86_64 -boot menu=on,splash-time=10000 -bios
  timeout=1000` (various combinations)
* running `grub2-editenv - set menu_auto_hide=0` and  `grub2-editenv
  /boot/grub2/grubenv set menu_auto_hide=0` (sets value in `grubenv` but
  doesn't work on reboot)
* editing `/etc/default/grub`,  adding `GRUB_TIMEOUT=10` and
  `GRUB_TIMEOUT_STYLE=menu`, and running `grub2-mkconfig -o
  /boot/grub2/grub.cfg --update-bls-cmdline` (and confirmed that this is
  updating `/boot/grub2/grub.cfg`) apparently increased the time to boot but
  the boot menu wasn't displayed

? What does `/etc/default/grub` and `/boot/grub2/grubenv` actually control,
and where are their options defined?

! GRUB_TIMEOUT is in seconds
