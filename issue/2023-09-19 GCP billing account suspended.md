Several minutes after successfully enabling a GCP billing account for `priam@aonalu.net`, a red warning banner appeared in the GCP console: "Your billing account has been suspended pending account verification" for Google Cloud 01DC5F-4AC1A7-C9BE11.

The billing account shows a $300 "Free trial credit" with "91 days remaining."

Notably, when the GCP account was set up, an additional $100 (total $400) was supposedly going to be added. There's no sign of this additional $100.

..accompanied by a "VERIFY ACCOUNT" link. Clicking this link takes you to the "PAYMENT OVERVIEW" tab in the [Billing Overview section for the card in question](https://console.cloud.google.com/billing/01DC5F-4AC1A7-C9BE11/payment). However, nothing in this section indicates a problem; $0 balance, no balance due, 

I re-submitted the same MasterCard information for a new billing account named `My Billing Account .again,Â 0161D5-A702F1-98CCAB`. It seems to have worked OK. **But there's no sign of the $300 credit.**

Meanwhile, the GCP account for `priamk@gmail.com` (which had to be enabled to get access to AppEngine to handle the [[2023-09-20 End old www.aonalu.net hosting]] issue) allowed me to "Activate" the $300 credit once I logged into GCP, and there isn't a time limit on it. Also, it's using the same MasterCard. Billing info here: https://console.cloud.google.com/billing/01993F-DF15BA-66795C/

Many people seem to have the same issue, minus the disappearing credit: https://issuetracker.google.com/issues/2301984460
