The sticky bit permission (`1000`, `+t`) ensures that only the user who is the
owner of the file or the directory that contains the file is allowed to delete
the file.

Set Group ID (SGID, `2000`, `+s`) ensures that all files created in the shared
group directory are group owned by the group owner of the directory. It
normally just makes sense to restrict SGID to the group portion of the
permissions (`g+s`).

```
chmod g+s mydir  # apply SGID to mydir
chmod +t         # apply sticky bit to mydir ("restricted deletion flag")

chmod 3770 mydir # assigns SGID and sticky along with 770 (ug+rwx)
```

Using `stat` to show octal permissions:
```
stat -c "%a %A %n" /tmp
```

`find` and `while read line` work nicely:
```
  cd /etc ; \
  stat -c "%a %n" `find . -true -print` \
  | while read line ; \
    do cd /mnt/broken/etc ; \
    chmod $line ;
  done
```

"Only root (i.e. UID 0) or a process with `CAP_FOWNER` can change the
permissions of a file it does not own." "Only root (i.e. `UID 0`) or a process
with `CAP_CHOWN` can change the owner of a file."
