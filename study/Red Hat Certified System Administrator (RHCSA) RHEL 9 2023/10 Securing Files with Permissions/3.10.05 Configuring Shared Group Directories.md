Set Group ID (SGID) ensures that all files created in the shared group
directory are group owned by the group owner of the directory.

The sticky bit permission ensures that only the user who is the owner of the
file or the directory that contains the file is allowed to delete the file.

chmod g+s mydir  # apply SGID to mydir
chmod +t         # apply sticky bit to mydir ("restricted deletion flag")

chmod 3770 mydir # assigns SGID and sticky along with 770 (ug+rwx)

Using stat below to show octal permissions.

Wow. The find and while read line work nicely:

  cd /etc ; \
  stat -c "%a %n" `find . -true -print` \
  | while read line ; \
    do cd /mnt/broken/etc ; \
    chmod $line ;
  done

"Only root (i.e. UID 0) or a process with CAP_FOWNER can change the
permissions of a file it does not own." "Only root (i.e. UID 0) or a process
with CAP_CHOWN can change the owner of a file."
