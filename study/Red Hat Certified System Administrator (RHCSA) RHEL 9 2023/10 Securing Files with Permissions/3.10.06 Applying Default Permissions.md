[[umask]]

Default value for `umask` is set in `/etc/bashrc`.

Overridden in `~/.bashrc`.

Default file perms are 666. Default folder perms are 777.

`umask` of `027` results in `640` for files (-1 for executable just becomes 0) and
`750` for directories.

`umask` can only prevent bits from being set. It cannot set bits.

Also, from https://unix.stackexchange.com/q/352314: "By convention, numbers
that are prefixed by 0 are understood to be octal. So, 0022 means 022 octal
notation. Since umasks are octal anyway, setting it to 0022 is not necessary.
