[[chmod]]

chmod 750 filename
chmod u+rwx filename
chmod ugo+rw  filename
chmod +x  filename

Remember: Users with write permissions on a directory can delete files from
that directory - file ownership doesn't prevent deletion. Deletion is a write
on a directory:

	su -l
	mkdir /tmp/dir
	chown someone:someone /tmp/dir
	chmod 750 /tmp/dir
	
	touch /tmp/dir/file
	chown root:root /tmp/dir/file
	chmod 700 /tmp/dir/file
	
	su -l someone
	rm /tmp/dir/file
