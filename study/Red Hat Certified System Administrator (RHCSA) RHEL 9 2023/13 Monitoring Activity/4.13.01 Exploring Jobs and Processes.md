All tasks are started as processes.

Processes have a PID.

Common process management tasks include scheduling priority and sending
signals.

Some processes start multiple threads, individual threads cannot be managed.

Tasks that are started from a shell can be managed as jobs.

Shell jobs can be started in the foreground or background.
