[[top]]

Basically `top` then `f`:
1. select, move, and order fields
2. toggle which ones display
3. toggle which one sorts, `R` to reverse sort

Check `top` load averages - also available as `uptime`.

Press `1` to see individual CPU states.

`top` CPU fields - see `man top` "TASK and CPU States". Notably `wa` is
waiting on I/O which might not be good.

`k` prompts for a PID and then a signal number, like 15 for `SIGTERM`. See
`man 7 signal`.

`W` saves configuration to `~/.config/procps/toprc`. Manually move, rename,
etc. this file to recall previous saved configurations. Apparently you can't
read from a particular file via command line argument. It writes where it
writes and reads from where it reads.

`man top`:
* "Sorting"
* "INTERACTIVE Commands"

`top`:
* `f` show/select display fields
* `M` filter on memory
* `W` save new display settings
* Sorting by state makes it easy to look for zombies.

`htop` - good but not installed by default.
