Tasks enter a queue, then a scheduler figures out how to schedule the tasks,
one they are scheduled then each scheduled task gets a time slice in a CPU,
then when the time is up, the task is removed from the CPU and does it all
over again.

[[uptime]]
[[lscpu]]

```
uptime

lscpu | grep Hz
lscpu | grep CPU
```

`uptime` averages should be less than the number of `top` "Cpus" or parallel
threads of execution.

See also `top`, count number of "Cpus". These are parallel threads of
execution.

Clarifing CPUs, processors, cores, and threads:

```
cat /proc/cpuinfo

physical id : 0
siblings    : 8
core id     : 1
cpu cores   : 4
```
The physical processor `0` has 4 cores, each hyperthreaded to "[deliver] two
processing threads per physical core". Compare with `lscpu`.
