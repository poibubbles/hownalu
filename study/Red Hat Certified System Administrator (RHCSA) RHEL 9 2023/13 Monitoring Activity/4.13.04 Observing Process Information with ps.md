Search for `state` in `man 1 ps` and `man 7 credentials` for more information
on process IDs; PID, PPID, group ID, and session ID. Sessions would be like a
shell session and groups would be like processes that run as a result of a
command run in the shell.

From `man 7 credentials`:
```
A process group  (sometimes  called  a "job")  is  a  collection of processes
that share the same process group ID; the shell creates a new process group
for the process(es) used to execute single command or pipeline (e.g., the two
processes created to execute the  command  "ls | wc" are  placed  in  the
same  process  group).  A process's group membership can be set using
setpgid(2).  The process whose process ID is the same as its process group ID
is the process group leader for that group.

A session is a collection of processes that share the same session ID.  All of
the members of a process  group  also  have the  same  session ID (i.e., all
of the members of a process group always belong to the same session, so that
sessions and process groups form a strict two-level hierarchy of processes.)
A new session is created when a process calls  setsid(2), which  creates a new
session whose session ID is the same as the PID of the process that called
setsid(2).  The creator of the session is called the session leader.
```
