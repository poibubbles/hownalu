Linux like to use up memory for caching, therefore memory is likely to be
saturated. Swap is buffer overflow RAM emulation on disk. Inactive application
memory is moved to swap. Inactive cache memory is dropped.

Commit file write buffers with `pdflush`. Immediately after a file write, it's
not necessarily secure. Manually use `sync` command to make sure write cache
is flushed.

```
free -m  # buff/cache when writing files, committed to disk by pdflush

less /proc/meminfo
..
Active:          5235732 kB
Inactive:        9339440 kB
Active(anon):    4068084 kB    # anon: application usage
Inactive(anon):    50032 kB
Active(file):    1167648 kB    # file: cache usage
Inactive(file):  9289408 kB
..
```

In GRUB boot menu, try appending `mem=1G` to kernel boot option to limit
memory to demonstrate swap use (and slow things down a bit).
