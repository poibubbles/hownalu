Group passwords - for fun, apparently group passwords aren't used much.

	gpassword members  # set a group password for group 'members'
	
	# then someone who *isn't* a member of 'members' wants to join it
	newgrp users
	password:
	
	# then that user is in a subshell with GID as 'members'

Q. What's the point of `groupadd -o` (non-unique GID)?

A. Dunno. Guess it works like a synonym since permissions and whatnot all use
group IDs. Online chatter seems to think that in the case of ambiguity,
whatever is first in `/etc/group` will be used/reported as the group name.

Apparently there's a 15 group limit per user.
