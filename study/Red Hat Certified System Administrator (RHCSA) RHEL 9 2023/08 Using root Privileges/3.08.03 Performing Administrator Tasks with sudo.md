/etc/sudoers

Q. Where is bad password or "not in the sudoers file" incident reported?
A. /var/log/secure. Also, the several logs of the incident start with an
`pam_unix su` entry and then a more verbose `sudoers` entry spell out who
tried to run what.

Q. Apparently the first user you install on RHEL8 will have administrative/sudo
privileges ..but 'student' isn't in /etc/sudoers.. how can?
A. Because the `wheel` group has `ALL=(ALL) ALL` in `/etc/sudoers` and
`student` is in the `wheel` group.
