`dnf` groups are collections of packages.

An environment group is used to install a specific usage patter and may
consist of packages and groups.

```
dnf group list
dnf group list hidden  # show groups installed through environment groups
dnf group info <groupname>

dnf group install # installs only mandatory and default packages
dnf group install --with-optional # gets optional packages as well

```

Another Fedora 41 difference - F41 lists packages in a group, not groups in a
group?
