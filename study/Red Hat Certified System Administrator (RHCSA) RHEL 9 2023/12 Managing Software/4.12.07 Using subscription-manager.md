```
subscription-manager --help subscription-manager register
subscription-manager attach --auto
subscription-manager unregister
```

System will be registered with the hostname. 

Entitlement certificates in `/etc/pki/product/`.
Registered account in `/etc/pki/consumer/`.
Which subscription is attached in `/etc/pki/entitlement/`.

Use `rct` to check current entitlements:
```
rct cat-cert /etc/pki/entitlement/xxxx.pem
```

Looks like by default the entitlement lasts for 1 year.
