```
dnf list 'selinux*'
dnf search <string>  # searches name and descriptions only
dnf search all <string> # searches deeper
dnf provides */Containerfile  # deepest search, why no globbing?
```

Also, Sander says the `*/` in `provides` is "mandatory" although F41 seems to
work OK without it. However, there was a difference in output between:
```
dnf provides */ls  # had a little more info
dnf provides ls
```

```
dnf install --repo=repoID       # same as..
dnf install --disablerepo="*" --enablerepo=repoID
dnf remove
dnf update
dnf update kernel  # doesn't typically replace - keeps old one
```

```
dnf --destdir=./ download httpd
```

Note differing behavior on Fedora 41 where `dnf search all name` finds matches
that includ both `name` and `all`. On F41 use `--all`.
