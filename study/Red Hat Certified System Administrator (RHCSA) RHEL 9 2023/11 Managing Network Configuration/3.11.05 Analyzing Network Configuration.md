`ip` - good for temporary testing, but need Network Manager for persistent
changes

`ip addr`:
```
  ip addr add dev ens33 10.0.0.10/24
  ..where ens33 is a link name (ip link show)
```

`ip link`:
```
  ip -s link  # link stats, lots of stuff like collisions not important
              # anymore because the switch is handling the nasty parts
```

`ip route`:
```
ip route show
ip route add default via 10.0.0.1
ip route add 2.2.2.0/24 via 10.0.0.1  # valid, but dies with dummy gateway
```

```

```

Don't use ifconfig. It won't get secondary addresses added by `ip addr add`.

It's too far behind and isn't in minimal install. Man page says it's obsolete.
