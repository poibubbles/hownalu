In NetworkManager, devices are network interfaces.

Connections are collections of configuration settings for a device, stored in
the configuration file in  `/etc/NetworkManager/system-connections`.

`/etc/sysconfig/network-scripts` is supported but deprecated.

Only one connection can be active for a device.

Permissions to modify settings are applied through [[dbus]].
