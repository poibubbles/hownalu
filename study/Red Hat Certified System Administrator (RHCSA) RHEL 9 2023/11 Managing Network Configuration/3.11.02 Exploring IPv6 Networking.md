Address assignment
[[SLAAC]] Stateless Address Autoconfiguration
1. A host sends router solicitation to ff02::2 multicast group to access all
   routers.

2. A router answers that request, sending relevant information.

3. The host adds an automatically generated host ID (unlike fixed, not-privacy
   friendly MAC addresses bound to hardware) to the network prefix to obtain a
   unique address.

RHEL9 needs the [[radvd]] RPM to handle SLAAC.
