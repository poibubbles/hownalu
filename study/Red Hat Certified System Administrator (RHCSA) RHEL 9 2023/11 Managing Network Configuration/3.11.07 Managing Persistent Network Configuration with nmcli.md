Don't use `nmcli` on the exam. Too much.
```
nmcli con show
nmcli dev status

# trying this for real 
nmcli con add con-name yoyocon ifname wlp3s0 \
ipv4.addresses 192.168.1.139/24 ipv4.gateway 192.168.1.1 \
ipv4.method manual type ethernet
# worked

nmcli con add con-name yoyocon ifname wlp3s0 ipv4.addresses 192.168.1.139/24 \
ipv4.gateway 192.168.1.1 ipv4.method manual type wifi ssid CPORTmarine
# this one too
nmcli con up yoyocon
Error: Connection activation failed: The Wi-Fi network could not be found
Hint: use 'journalctl -xe NM_CONNECTION=ef9545c2-55c4-4850-8b97-658c650f6d56 +
NM_DEVICE=wlp3s0' to get more details.
# Also hint - didn't see anywhere in the journalctl output where the network
# could not be found.

nmcli connection show
nmcli dev status

nmcli conn show mynewconnection # shows all connection settings
nmcli con mod # will modify settings - use tab completion
nmcli con reload # will reload the modified connection
```

* Use `ipv3.method manual` on connections that don't use DHCP. Because..
* A DHCP server will be contact even if a statis configuration has been set.

Do use `nmtui` on the exam.
