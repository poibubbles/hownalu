Startup files:
* `/{etc,~}/profile` - generic settings processed in a login shell (upon
   authentication)
* `/{etc,~}/bashrc` - processed while opening a subshell

To play nice with RPMs, `/etc/profile.d/*` has a bunch of package-specific
stuff to include in your default profile.

Looks like for users, modify `~/.bash_profile` because it says so in the
default comments.
