Always put regexes in single quotes.

`man 7 regex` ("lots of information that you don't want to know about")

Double check for extended regular expressions. Because output will probably
just be blank if extended syntax doesn't work as intended.

`\b` end of word `grep '^Hello\b'`
`*` zero or more times `grep 'n.*x'`
`+` one or more times (extended) `grep -E 'bi+t'`
`?` zero or one time (extended) `grep -E 'bi?t'`
`n\{3\}` n occurs 3 times  `grep 'bon\{3\}nen'`
string must be a word  `'\banna\b'`
`.` one character `grep '^.$'`
either option (extended) `grep -E '(cpu|model)' /proc/info` spaces in
parenthesis matter

From the lab at the end:

	grep alex * | grep -V alexander
