[[tuned]]

System tuning.

Kernel tunables are in `/proc/sys`. Not persistent. If you want persistent,
write to `/etc/syscfg.d/` (HEREDOC):
```
cat >> swappiness.conf <<EOF
vm.swappiness = 40
EOF
```

Or, live:
```
echo 40 > /proc/sys/vm/swappiness

sysctl -a             # show system tunables
sysctl vm.swappiness
```

`tuned` makes it somewhat easier to manage 1000+ tunable parameters.

```
tuned-adm list  # shows profiles

Cannot talk to TuneD daemon via DBus. Is TuneD daemon running?

dnf install tuned
systemctl status tuned
systemctl start tuned.service
systemctl enable tuned.service
```

Profiles are stored in `/usr/lib/tuned/*/tuned.conf`.

In `/etc/tuned/tuned-main.conf` give `syscfg.d/*` configurations priority:
```
reapply_sysctl = 1
```

Making your own profile:
```
mkdir /etc/tuned/myprofile
cat >> /etc/tuned/myprofile/tuned.conf <<EOF
[sysctl]
vm.swappiness = 55
EOF
tuned-adm list | grep myprofile 
tuned-adm profile myprofile

# double check tunables, if unexpected
# check reapply_sysctl = 1 in /etc/tuned/tuned-main.conf
# and either change that to 0 or do whatevs

systemctl restart tuned.service  # restart to re-read/apply configs
```
