Cgroups can limit CPU cycles, memory, and much much more!

Else `nice` and `renice`.

Nice values from -20 to 19. Aggressive to passive. Relative to other
processes.

Users can set processes to lower priority, to increase priority gotta be root.

```
nice -n 19 command...
```

Demo:
```
nice -n 10  dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/null & 
nice -n -10 dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/null &

# check top, note aggressive and passive prolly using same CPU amount

# turn off a CPU
cd /sys/bus/cpu/devices
tree
cat /sys/bus/cpu/devices/cpu0/online        # 1
echo 0 > /sys/bus/cpu/devices/cpu0/online

# check top, note aggressive and passive using much different CPU amount
```




Cgroups divide Linux systems into 3 slices:

* System
* User
* Machine - VMs and containers

"Each slice has equal CPU weight. If one or more processes within a slice
requests a maximum amount of CPU cycles, each slice will get an equal amount
of CPU shares. So 20 systemd processes together get as much as one user
process that claims full CPU usage! In systemd, the CPUWeight can be set on
individual system units."
