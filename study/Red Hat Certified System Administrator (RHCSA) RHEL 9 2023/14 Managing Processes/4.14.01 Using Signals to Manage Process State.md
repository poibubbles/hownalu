"Interrupts" come from hardware.

"Signals" allow the OS to interrupt a process.

See `man 7 signals`. Not installed by default but available in installer as
`man-pages` and `man-pages-overrides`.

[[kill]]
[[killall]]
[[pkill]]

```
killall dd   # kill by name
kill         # by process
```

SIGTERM (15) vs SIGKILL (9): SIGTERM asks the process to stop, and the process
is free to do what it really wants. SIGKILL kills it on the OS level ("force
quit").

Killing zombies:

* Run `zombie` from https://github.com/sandervanvugt/rhcsa/zombie.
* `ps aux | grep zombie` and note PID and PPID.
* `kill <child PID>` will fail.
* `kill -SIGCHLD <parent PID>` will be ignored.
* `kill <parent PID>` - the zombie will be adopted by init and killed/reaped.
