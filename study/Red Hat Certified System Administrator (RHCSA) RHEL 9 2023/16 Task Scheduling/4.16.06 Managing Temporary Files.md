In the past, temp files were in `/tmp` and sometimes on a RAM drive.

Now "unused" files are managed by `systemd-tempfiles`. "Unused" means not
modified or accessed for a period of time determined in their respective
`tmpfiles.d` configurations.

`systemd-tmpfiles-clean.timer` determines when
`systemd-tmpfiles-clean.service` is actually run and all the cleaning is done.
Files and directories aren't cleaned as a result of being unused per se - the
service that cleans them out *based on their timestamps* must be run.

Now `systemd-tmpfiles` is started when booting, and manages temporary files
and directories via:
```
/usr/lib/tmpfiles.d/ # RPM-provided stuff
/etc/tmpfiles.d      # custom stuff
/run/tmpfiles.d      # system generated stuff
```

```
systemd-tmpfiles                # manages temp files
systemd-tmpfiles-setup.service  # creates/removes temp files via configs
systemd-tmpfiles-clean.timer    # calls systemd-tmpfiles-clean.service
                                # 15 min after boot, and
                                # daily thereafter
```

See `man tmpfiles.d`:
```
d /run/myfiles 0750 root root     # creates dir only if doesn't exist
D /run/myfiles 0750 root root 1d  # wipes dir if it exists then creates
```

Demo:
```
echo "q /tmp 1777 root root 7d" > /etc/tmpfiles.d/tmp.conf
systemd-tmpfiles --clean /etc/tmpfiles.d/tmp.conf  # check syntax

echo "d /tmp/myfiles 0770 root root 30s" > /etc/tempfiles.d/myfiles.conf
systemd-tmpfiles --clean /etc/tmpfiles.d/myfiles.conf  # check syntax

ls -ld /tmp/myfiles
systemd-tmpfiles --create /etc/tempfiles.d/myfiles.conf
ls -ld /tmp/myfiles

touch /tmp/myfiles/test
ls -ld /tmp/myfiles/test
sleep 30
ls -ld /tmp/myfiles/test
systemd-tmpfiles --clean /etc/tmpfiles.d/myfiles.conf
```

```
systemd-analyze cat-config tmpfiles.d
```
