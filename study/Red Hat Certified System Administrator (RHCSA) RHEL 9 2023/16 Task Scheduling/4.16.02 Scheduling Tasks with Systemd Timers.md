Timers need `unit.service` files.

The *timer* should be enabled, not the service unit.

Timers prolly installed by RPM.

`OnCalendar` option in timer file specifies when the service should be
started.


```
systemctl list-units -t timer
systemctl cat systemd-tmpfiles-clean.timer

systemctl list-unit-files logrotate.*
systemctl status logrotate.service
systemctl status logrotate.timer
dnf instally -y sysstat
systemctl list-unit-files sysstat.*
systemctl status sysstat-collect.timer
```

It might take a little while after `init q` or `systemctl daemon-reload` for
`systemctl list-unit-files sysstat.*`  to show all the `systat.*` stuff. To
get an expectation, `rpm -ql sysstat` then check the `systemctl` stuff.

Make sure `systat` is running so that `sar` can get info.
```
sar -A
Cannot open /var/log/sa/sa13: No such file or directory
Please check if data collecting is enabled

systemctl cat sysstat
```

See `man 7 systemd.time` and `man 5 systemd.timer`:
```
OnCalendar=*:00/10   # every 10 minutes
OnCalendar=2023-*-* 9:9,19,29:30

OnUnitActivateSec    # activate after a unit was activated

OnBootSec            # activate after a specific time
OnStartupSec         # ..what's the difference?
```

Example:
```
cat >> /etc/systemd/system/touchfile.service <<EOF
[Unit]
Description=demo unit

[Service]
Type=oneshot
ExecStart=/user/bin/touch /tmp/myfile.txt
EOF

cat >> /etc/systemd/system/touchfile.timer <<EOF
[Unit]
Description=demo timer

[Timer]
OnCalendar=*:00/01
EOF

systemctl daemon-reload
systemctl start touchfile.timer
systemctl status touchfile.service
watch ls -l /tmp/myfile.txt
systemctl stop touchfile.timer
```

From `man 5 systemd.timer`:
"Note that in case the unit to activate is already active at the time the
timer elapses it is not restarted, but simply left running. There is no
concept of spawning new service instances in this case. Due to this, services
with RemainAfterExit= set (which stay around continuously even after the
service's main process exited) are usually not suitable for activation via
repetitive timers, as they will only be activated once, and then stay around
forever."
