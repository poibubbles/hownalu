HINTED THAT THIS ON THE EXAM

`crond` is enabled as a `systemd` service.

Checks its configuration every minute.

`/etc/cron.d/` for custom drop-in `cron` files.

Also `/etc/cron.{hourly,daily,weekly,monthly}` are for dropping in scripts.
Make sure the scripts are executable!

User specific `cron` jobs can be created using `crontab -e`.

Run a job at minute 0 every Monday through Friday in December:
```
0 * * dec 1-5 logger HELLO
```

See `/etc/crontab` for timer example. Don't edit it though.
