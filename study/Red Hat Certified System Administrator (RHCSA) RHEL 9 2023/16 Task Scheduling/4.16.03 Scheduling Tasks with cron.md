**HINTED THAT THIS ON THE EXAM**

`crond` is enabled as a `systemd` service.

Checks its configuration every minute.

`/etc/cron.d/` for custom drop-in `cron` files.

Also `/etc/cron.{hourly,daily,weekly,monthly}` are for dropping in scripts.
Make sure the scripts are executable!

User specific `cron` jobs can be created using `crontab -e`.

Run a job at minute 0 every Monday through Friday in December:
```
crontab -e

> 0 * * dec 1-5 logger HELLO

crontab -l  # list the crontab

systemctl restart crond  # ensure it doesn't take long to re-read its config
```

See `/etc/crontab` for timer example. Don't edit it though. The crontabs that
are created with `crontab -e` wind up in `/var/spool/cron/<username>`.
