`atd` service must be running to run once-only jobs.

Check `systemctl status atd`.

`at <time>` to schedule a job. Add one or more job specifications in the
interactive shell. Ctrl-D closes the shell.

`atq` lists jobs currently scheduled.

`atrm` removes jobs from the scheduled list.

`at teatime` - `teatime` is `4PM` (built-in).

```
at teatime
at> touch /tmp/teatime
Ctrl-d
```

`at` `timespec` examples:
```
2pm             # today at 2pm
11:15 tomorrow
13:00 tomorrow 2025-02-04
at noon
at midnight
at teatime
at now + 1 minute  # not in seconds, see timespec above
```

If you need to edit `at` jobs, check `/var/spool/at`.
