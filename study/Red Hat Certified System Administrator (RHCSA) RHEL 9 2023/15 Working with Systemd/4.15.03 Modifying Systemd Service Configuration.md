See `/usr/lib/systemd/system/`.

Don't touch these guys because they're updated by RPMs.

Runtime auto-generated unit files in `/run/systemd/`. Customize in
`/etc/systemd/system/`. Or.. ..even better: `systemctl edit unit.service`

Whatever is in the edited version will show up in `/etc/systemd/system/`.

`systemctl show` shows available parameters.

`man 7 systemd.directives` is an index of configuration directives like
`Type=`, `RestartSec=`, 

```
systemctl cat httpd.service   # show contents of files
systemctl show httpd.service  # show properties
systemctl edit httpd.service  # set EDITOR=/usr/bin/vim
systemctl cat httpd.service   # differences subject to daemon-reload
# Edits in /etc/systemd/system/httpd.service.d/override.conf.

# If edits don't show up in `systemctl cat`
systemctl daemon-reload     # old school, shouldn't have to
# or..
init q   # according to RHEL docs

systemctl reload httpd
systemctl restart httpd
```

Testing edits to *existing* `[Service]` section in  `systemctl edit
httpd.service`:
```
[Service]
```
Difference between `systemctl cat` and `systemctl show`?

The dash in some paths, for example `/usr/lib/systemd/system/sshd.service`:
```
[Service]
EnvironmentFile=-/etc/sysconfig/sshd
```
"If the executable path is prefixed with "-", an exit code of the command
normally considered a failure (i.e. non-zero exit status or abnormal exit due
to signal) is recorded, but has no further effect and is considered equivalent
to success."
From Table 1. Special executable prefixes in
https://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/systemd.service.html.
