When logged in `Ctrl + Alt + Fn2` is GUI.
When logged in `Ctrl + Alt + Fn3-6` text virtual terminals.

* [[who]]

* [[w]]

* [[chvt]] - change virtual terminals

  As an unprivileged user, `chvt 3` will fail: `Couldn't get a file descriptor
  referring to the console.`

? What is the `seat0` TTY that shows up in `w` for the user using Gnome?

? Can we trace `ttyN` to figure out more about how a user is logged in?
For example, if we use `who --all` to get PIDs of the terminal sessions, then
`ps <PID>` we'll get something like:

	/sbin/agetty -o -p -- \u --noclear - linux

..so maybe `/sbin/agetty` instead of something like `gdm-wayland-session` or
and SSH login?
