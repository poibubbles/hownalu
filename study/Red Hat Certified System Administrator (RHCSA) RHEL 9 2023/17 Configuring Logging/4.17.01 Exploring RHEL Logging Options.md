`systemd-journald` receives log messages from different locations..

- the kernel
- early boot procedure
- syslog events
- standard out and error from daemons

The `systemd` journal is non-persistent by default. Because..

`rsyslog` reads `syslog` messages and writes them to different locations..

- files in `/var/log`
- according to `rsyslog` output modules
- services may also write to `/var/log`
