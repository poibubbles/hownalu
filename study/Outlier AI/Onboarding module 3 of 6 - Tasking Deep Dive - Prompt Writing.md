### Building blocks of a good prompt

* Identify the ask. What do you need the model to do?  Be clear and specific. (Write an email..)
* Provide context. Give the necessary background. Who is this for? What is the occasion or purpose?
* Define output expectations. What does a good result look like? Is the tone casual or formal? Should it be a poem, a list, or a story?

Prompts must be sufficiently **complex** and maintain a **natural conversational tone**.

**Is your prompt complex enough?**

Prompt complexity is key to creating rich, realistic interactions with AI. In order for AI models to learn, they need to be pushed to the edge of their capabilities (where they sometimes get things **right**...and sometimes get things **wrong**.)

**Two strategies (there are many more!):**

- **Constraints:** Introduce limitations or conditions that shape how the AI responds.
- **Personas:** Ask the AI to take on a specific role or personality.

**Does your prompt sound natural and conversational?**

Remember that our goal is to teach AI models how to be more useful to real users. The prompts we write should feel like a natural conversation between two people.

**Our top tips for driving a natural sounding conversation:**
- Write as if you're speaking to someone directly.
- Incorporate relatable examples and real-life contexts.
- Don't abruptly change the topic mid-conversation.
- **Remember that even complexity should be natural!**
- If you're asking for a history lesson on submarines, asking for the response to rhyme in an AABB structure is not a natural...
