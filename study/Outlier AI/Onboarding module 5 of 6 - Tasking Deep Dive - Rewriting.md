**From good to great**

We wrapped up our last deep dive with **preference ranking,** in which you pick your preferred AI model response out of two choices. Preference ranking helps teach the AI model the difference between **good** and **bad** responses...

...but wouldn't it be nice if the **good** response was **_as good as it possibly could be_**? This is where rewriting comes in.

**Rewriting**

When you’re rewriting your preferred AI model response to improve it, apply the same rubric you used to rate it. Remember, just because you preferred a response doesn’t mean it scored perfectly on all dimension like safety, accuracy, and instruction-following. Use your project rubric to ensure it meets all the necessary standards.

**Two final comments:**

- Once you've done your rewrites, double-check your work! **A mistake we see all the time is contributors introducing new errors while rewriting.**
- On projects, you'll sometimes see reference to **major** and minor rewrites.
- **Major** tends to refer to rewrites involving core rating dimensions like accuracy.
- Minor usually refers to styling touch-ups.
- In either case, as long as you are rewriting the AI model response to be perfect, you should be in great shape!

Key takeaways:

- Your rewrites should take a response from **good to perfect.**
- Rewrites should fix **important response dimensions AND writing style.**
