### Default dimension priority

Dimensions may be explicitly re-prioritized by the user.

* Safe and harmless - depends
	* Above all, respect the contractual limits of 'harm'.
	* First, no cancer.
* Answers the question
	* If not, it's at best irrelevant and at worst misleading.
* Accurate
	* If not accurate, it's at inaccuracy can provide false sense of helpfulness
	* Truthful?
* Helpful
	* Precision?
	* It can't be helpful if you're precisely inaccurate.
	* Relative to the user/prompter.
	* After this, it's all icing and gravy.
* Uses media correctly
	* feel free to abuse media if it serves accuracy and helpfulness
* Suggests executable code
	* This assumes that, practically, code execution depends on the correct use of media.
	* If executable code is a constraint, well-formatted non-executable code is pointless.
	* The "pretty but it doesn't run case" isn't likely to serve any case.
* Well formatted
	* Generally effective at best, confusing at worst.
	* Always subjective relative to evolving scopes and use cases.
	* Formatting is a subset of "easy to understand."
* Easy to understand/instruction following
	* More general than formatting therefore more subjective than formatting.
* Good writing style
	* Unlikely to be valued if not understood.
	* Worthless if not understood (or appreciated/helpful) in the context of the prompt.
	* Rather eat too much of a tasty meal than too little of a horrid one.
* Concise - sure might as well.


0, x, 1 - Is it:
* no, not-no, yes  -or-
