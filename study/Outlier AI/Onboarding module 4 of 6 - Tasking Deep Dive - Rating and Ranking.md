### **Responses**

When you submit your prompt on a task, an AI model will typically generate two responses. It will likely make a few mistakes if you've written your prompt to be challenging enough.

We rely on your expertise to teach the AI model where it went wrong and how it can do better next time. Our two main teaching tools are **response ratings** and **preference ranking**.

**What makes a "good" or "bad" response?**

Across all types of responses, we generally want AI models to respond in the way smart humans do!

### Dimensions

* Accurate
* Safe and harmless
* Concise
* Answers the question
* Good writing style
* Easy to understand - instruction following?
* Well formatted
* Uses media correctly
* Helpful
* Suggests executable code

**Safety & harmlessness**

On Outlier, we have the opportunity to instill a "Do No Harm" mentality in the AI models we work on. Always be on the lookout for responses that are malicious or reveal sensitive personal information.

**Instruction following (a.k.a. "answers the question")**

If an AI model doesn't directly answer the user's questions in the way it's being asked to, it didn't do its job. No one likes someone who can't follow directions.

**Accuracy (a.k.a truthfulness, factuality)**

You might have heard of models that "hallucinate" or make things up. By fact-checking models, we prevent the spread of misinformation and lies. **When in doubt, Google it!**

## Quiz

**Prompt:**

_I've been wanting to learn more about the history of Asian communities. Can you suggest some good books to start with? Include female authors and the date they were published. Three books will be enough. I don't need details on the books though!_

**Response:**

1. _"The Woman Warrior: Memoirs of a Girlhood Among Ghosts"_ _by Maxine Hong Kingston, published in 1976. This memoir blends autobiography with Chinese folklore, exploring Kingston's experiences growing up as a Chinese-American._
2. _"Wild Swans: Three Daughters of China"_ _by Jung Chang, published in 1991. Chang recounts the lives of her grandmother, mother, and herself; reflecting on life under different tumultuous periods in 20th-century China including the Cultural Revolution._
3. _"Nisei Daughter"_ _by Monica Sone, published in 1953. In this autobiography, Sone describes her life as a second-generation Japanese American growing up in Seattle in the 1920s and 1930s before being sent to an internment camp during World War II._

_These books provide insights into different periods in the history of specific Asian communities from the personal perspectives of female authors, showcasing both cultural backgrounds and the intersections with pivotal historical events.

What would you check to confirm if this response is accurate? [SELECT ALL THAT APPLY]

Y The book title, author, and publication date

N Whether the Cultural Revolution occurred in 20th-century China under different periods.

N Whether World War II came after the 1920s and 30s.

Y Whether the authors are female

Answer was actually all Y. I disagreed:

### With respect to the the Asian history example:

In general, a response may accurately represent a book by echoing potentially inaccurate claims within the book, and a response may inaccurately represent a book by crediting it with accurate claims it doesn't actually make. 

Specifically, the accuracy of the history example's _response_ is not addressed either by confirming that "the Cultural Revolution occurred in 20th-century China under different periods" per se or by confirming that "World War II came after the 1920s and 30s" per se.

And since competing histories may disagree with each other, the prompt should probably include a tie-breaking standard or constraint, such as "..as commonly accepted in Western universities during the period 2000-2020.." 

### With respect to the mirepoix example:

The prompt concludes with: "respond in an organized way"o

The correct answer responds with: "Correct! Nothing is unsafe, but response B maps the countries to aromatic bases incorrectly and also doesn't follow the prompt's constraint around an organization's response."

The correct answer response should conclude with (something like) "..and also doesn't follow the prompt's constraint around an organized response."



**To avoid mistakes we see all the time, ask yourself...**

- Does your ranking generally **favor** the same response as your dimension ratings?
- Did you **mix up** the two responses (say A > B when you meant B > A)? This is more common than you think!

**But what if I can't tell which one is better?**

Remember that our goal in most cases is for our **prompt** to push the AI model to the _edge_ of its capabilities. Practically, that means we'd like the model to return one **good** and one **bad** response to review. In addition, the better one should jump off the page!

But let's say we're stuck with two responses that are extremely similar (both **good** or both **bad**).

- If both responses are **good**, you might need to go back and **add complexity** to your prompt.
- If both response are **bad**, you might need to **simplify** your prompt (although some projects are okay with this).

**Don't forget to show your work.**

The last thing we ask is that you explain all your choices and support with evidence. (You'll see the word **justification** in our UI a lot.) Ask yourself:

- Why is Response A inaccurate?
- Why is Response B better than Response A?

Answering these questions reinforces to AI models how they can do better next time.
