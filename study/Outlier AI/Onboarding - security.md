**Phishing** is a technique used by people trying to fraudulently gain access to your personal information by sending deceptive emails or asking you to visit suspicious websites.

DO:

- Filter out spam in your email
- Install antivirus software & keep it up to date
- Verify attachments and links before opening

DON’T:

- Click on unknown links in messages
- Open attachments from unknown contacts
- Trust unsolicited emails

**Malware** is malicious software that cybercriminals use to steal sensitive data, such as user credentials and financial information.

DO:

- Verify attachments and links before opening
- Verify software you are installing

DON’T:

- Install unauthorized software
- Download or open suspicious files or links

Media drives like USBs and CDs which contain malware can bypass network defenses, since they are plugged directly into your computer. Malware can autorun on plugin, or can serve dangerous files to click on. Removable media can also steal data, install ransomware, or destroy your computer.

DO:

- Disable autorun on all computers
- Scan the media with an antivirus software first

DON’T:

- Connect untrusted media to any of your devices
