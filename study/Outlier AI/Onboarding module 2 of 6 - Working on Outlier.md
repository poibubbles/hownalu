Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF)
Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT)

Work on Outlier is organized into projects. Each project generates a dataset that has been requested by one of our customers, and they use these datasets to improve their GenAI models.

- **Ramp-up** - When a project starts taking contributors in for tasking (some minor aspects of the project may be updated during this time)
- **Steady-state** - Most work occurs during a steady state when the project is fully operational
- **Ramp-down** - When a project has collected the necessary amount of data and will end soon

Empty queue (EQ) means there are no tasks available for you at the moment.

- If you fail an assessment task, you will no longer be eligible for the project and might EQ temporarily
- You can also be EQ because you failed a qualification / screening quiz
- **NOTE:** If you are in an empty queue after finishing an assessment question during project onboarding it’s likely you did not pass
- Consistently submitting low quality tasks

When you get an EQ please follow one of the below processes:

1. If you have access to the Marketplace, please return to the Marketplace and select another project (more on this later).
2. Otherwise, please be patient as we attempt to match you with a new project.

**Task Types**

There are two main types of tasks:

1. **Assessment Tasks**: These evaluate your skills and are paid at a lower rate.
2. **Deliverable Tasks**: These are the primary tasks, paid at the full rate if completed within the allocated time.

**Task Components**

Let's take a look at the components of a task:

- **Prompt**: The main question or request to an AI model
- **Model Responses**: AI-generated responses that you will interact with in different ways (rate, rank, rewrite, etc...)
- **Timer**: Tracks your time on the task
- **Specifications Doc**: Provides guidelines for completing the task
- Please fully review and use the spec doc to ensure you have an understanding of how to complete the task.

**Task Timer**

Managing the timer is key because the timer can affect your rate of pay.

- **Timer** - Timer indicates the amount of time Contributors have to complete the task for the full pay rate
- **Active Time** - This is the remaining time you have to complete the task
- **Pausing Time** - At any time you need to take a break or step away, please pause the timer to prevent any loss active time to complete the task
- **Exceeded Time -** Time worked in excess of the allocated time to complete the task. This will have a lower pay rate.

Tasks can also be skipped if at any time you feel uncomfortable completing a specific task.

**Task Throttle**

Some projects will have something called a "Task Throttle" for new contributors. This is a quality assurance check for new contributors and the first few tasks will be evaluated. At this moment you may get an EQ status. Feel free to return to the Marketplace and start a new project while this takes place.

## **Earnings Dashboard**

You can view your updated earnings and other relevant details on your dashboard. Earnings from tasking and missions may take a few hours to be updated in the system.

Contributor pay is stated in your offer letter to join Outlier and can also be seen on project cards

- **Note:** the rate in the offer letter is just an approximation of earning potential and the pay you see on the marketplace per project is what you **should actually expect**

**Pay Rate**

Project cards detail the pay rate for specific tasks. Ensure you review these cards carefully to understand your expected pay for each project. Pay rates are specified for each project and can differ based on the complexity and requirements of the task.

- **Assessment Task Rate**: This is a benchmark rate provided for assessment tasks, usually indicating the standard pay rate for completing assessments.
- **Deliverable Task Rate**: These rates are specific to individual projects and may vary from the benchmark rates. Always refer to the project card for the accurate rate applicable to a specific project.

**Missions**

Missions are project teams' way of saying “we want to reward you for doing some high priority actions”! They offer fixed rewards for finishing specific actions like courses or tasks.

**Mission Components**

When you click into a mission, you will see several key components:

1. **Requirements**: This includes specific tasks that need to be completed, such as finishing a course or completing particular assignments.
2. **Reward**: The monetary value for completing the mission. This is shown as a specific amount ($) and reflects the total payment for completing **all** the components of the mission.
3. **Example**: A mission might offer a reward of $50 for full completion.
4. **Time Limit**: Displays how much time remains before the mission expires. This helps you manage your time effectively and ensures you complete tasks within the given timeframe.
5. ﻿**Example**: A mission might show 2 days remaining.

#### **Full and Partial Completions**

Missions can be partially or fully earned. If the mission has multiple components and you only finish part of it, you will still be paid for the partial finish.

- **Full Completion**: Completing all the requirements for a mission, you will receive the full reward specified.
- **Partial Completion**: If a mission has multiple components and you complete only part of it, you will still be compensated for the components of the mission that you fully complete.
- **Payment for Partial Completion**: Payment is based on components completed.
- **Example**: A mission component could require you to work on a task for 1 hour.
- **Complete**: If you complete the full hour then you will get compensated.
- **Incomplete**: If you only do 30 minutes, then you will not get compensated since the task component was not complete.

**Please Don't Cheat!**

Outlier aims to generate high-quality data with the expertise and skills of its Contributors. Adhering to guidelines ensures the integrity and reliability of the data produced.

**Chatbots**

Using chatbots or AI to complete your tasks is considered cheating and undermines the quality of data. Our goal is to push the capabilities of AI models through genuine human expertise. Relying on AI for tasks detracts from the value of human-generated data and fails to contribute meaningfully to advancing AI technologies.

**We screen and check for chatbot usage on the platform in real time.**

**Contributor Expectations**

Use your own expertise and skill to complete tasks. This ensures that the data produced is valuable and accurately reflects human input.

#### **Consequences of Violations**

Violations of these rules can lead to penalties, including potential suspension or removal from the platform.

- **Deactivation**: Serious or repeated breaches of guidelines can result in you being deactivated on Outlier, impacting your ability to participate and earn.

**If you think your account got wrongfully deactivated at anytime, then reach out to support.**

Please also feel free to contact us at [**onboarding@outlier.ai**](mailto:onboarding@outlier.ai).

#### **High-Quality Contribution**

Exceptional contributions can unlock additional opportunities. Our top contributors are frequently invited to work on review-level tasks or join the Oracle program, where they will have the chance to pilot new projects.

Note: Submitting high quality work is always something to strive for but keep in mind that doing so does not necessarily mean you will be invited to join the Oracle program.

#### The Contributor Marketplace

lets you select the projects you want to work on. You can choose projects based on your skills, complete the necessary assessments, and start working right away. This flexibility helps minimize downtime, allowing you to quickly transition to new projects, while your current queue is empty.

**Features:**

- **Flexibility**: Contributors can select projects that align with their skills and availability, minimizing downtime between tasks.
- **Transparency**: Project details, including pay rates and eligibility requirements, are clearly provided upfront.
- **Progress Tracking**: A dedicated onboarding panel allows contributors to monitor their progress throughout the process.
- **Real-Time Updates**: Contributors receive immediate notifications if they encounter issues such as being disabled or blocked.

**Direct Assignments**

While you are in the new Marketplace, you may find projects labeled as Direct Assignments. These are urgent projects and often come with higher rewards.

- This is uncommon but generally done on projects that have a lot of rewards (missions) for doing the work.

#### **Outlier Community**

### My onboarding criticism:

Define terms before using them in an explanation. The 'EQ' section references 'Assessment tasks' before assessment tasks are defined and the 'Earnings Dashboard' section references 'tasking and missions' before missions are defined.

Consider rewording 'Consistently submitting low quality tasks' with 'Consistent low quality submissions' or some other result-oriented phrasing in the 'EQ' section; 'tasks' are provided to contributors, contributors provide results.

Consider distinguishing 'rewards' from 'missions' in the 'Direct Assignments' section.
