* Through the firmware, the bootloader is activated.
* The bootloader's purpose is to load the Linux kernel and the related [[initramfs]].
* Also, a boot menu can be presented to specify boot options.
* GRUB2 is the common bootloader on Linux.
* LILO and GRUB were used on legacy systems.
* Uboot is used on embedded Linux.
* Cloud instances may use their own bootloaders.
* Press `Esc` after firmware is loaded to access bootloader menu.
* `C` for command line (hardly used), `E` to edit boot options, `Ctrl-x` to boot.
* Kernel startup options are preceded by an offset of the number of seconds since startup, `OK` startup logs are from [[systemd]].
* `ro` specified before `rw` ..`rw` wins.
* `systemd.unit=rescue.target` is a good Systemd troubleshooting option. It drops you into a shell. `systemctl isolate graphical.target` to (resume? initiate?) to get from the shell to a GUI.
* Note that if `free -m` is lower than you expect, it might be because RAM is being used by video memory.
