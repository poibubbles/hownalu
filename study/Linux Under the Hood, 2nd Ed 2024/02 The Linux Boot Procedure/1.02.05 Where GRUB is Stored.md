* On BIOS, the first 512 bytes on disk are the boot sector.
	* 446 bytes are used for GRUB code.
	* 64 bytes are used for the partition table.
		* Enough for 4 partitions, not more.
		* 2 bytes used for magic code.
		* Magic code is just a magic identifier.
	* Next 32 sectors contain core Grub components, such as its core file and the modules it uses.
	* Use utilities like [[xxd]] and [[hexdump]] to investigate.
* On UEFI, the UEFI information is on the EFI system partition.
	* This is vfat formatted partition mounted on `/boot/efi`.
	* Use `ls` and `cat` to see file contents directly from the OS itself, or from a rescue disk.

Demo GRUB on BIOS:

	xxd /dev/sda | less
	# look for 55aa in 1f0 for the end of the first sector,
	# 8004-55aa is partition table
