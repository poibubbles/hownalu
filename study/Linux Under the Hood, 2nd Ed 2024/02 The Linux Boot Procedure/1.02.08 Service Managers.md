* Service managers take care of everything after the kernel and [[initrd]] have been loaded and the root file system has been mounted.
* Stages:
	* Initialize remaining hardware devices (everything not initialized in [[initramfs]]).
	* Mount filesystems.
	* Starting services.
	* Start shell.
* [[systemd]] is most common.
* [[init]] and [[upstart]] are used on some distributions.
