* The linux kernel is modular.
* To keep kernel file small, on installation an [[initramfs]] (aka [[initrd]]) that contains all essential kernel modules is generated. "Essential" means "required to boot."
* [[initramfs]] is also responsible for loading the root filesystem.
* As the last step, [[initramfs]]  loads the [[init]] process (not yet [[systemd]]).
* When to update [[initramfs]]:
	* After hardware changes where new drivers may be provided or needed.
	* After kernel upgrades (updates happen automatically).
	* Add drivers not currently included.
	* After any other changes that involve the early boot stage (rare).
* To update [[initramfs]]:
	* `dracut -f` on RedHat
	* `update-initramfs -u` Ubuntu and related
Demo:

	lsinitrd | grep ext4
	vim /etc/dracut.conf.d/ext4.conf
	 add_drivers+=" ext4 "
	dracut -f
	lsinitrd # will show current contents
