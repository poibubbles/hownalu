* FIrmware is [[BIOS]] or [[UEFI]]
* Firmware finds a bootable disk.
* Disk uses [[MBR]] (1981 standard) or [[GPT]] (GUID partition table).
* MBR bootlog(?) finds GRUB, GPT finds the boot partition which finds GRUB.
* GRUB finds the kernel and [[initramfs]].
* [[initramfs]] contains all the drivers that are needed for the OS.
* The initial process (typically `init=systemd`) is loaded (and takes over).
* "Early boot" is all the essential stuff to have a functional computer.
* "Services" are loaded.
* "Shell" is loaded.
* Troubleshooting:
	* In anything goes wrong before GRUB you need a rescue disk, no doubt.
	* In RedHat, you can break in after loading `initramfs` by passing `RD.BREAK` option; you can see the disk because the drivers are loaded.
	* Before [[systemd]] is loaded you can jump in with `init=/bin/bash`.
	* Before early boot you can jump in with `systemd.unit=emergency.target` (ensures only bare minimum is available).
	* Before services start, `rescue.target`.
