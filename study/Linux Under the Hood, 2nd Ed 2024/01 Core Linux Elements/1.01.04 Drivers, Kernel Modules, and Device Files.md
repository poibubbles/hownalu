* Modules are normally loaded on-demand.
* Drivers operate in kernel space.
* Device nodes in `/dev`.
* Character devices send/receive bytes to/from peripherals.
	* They work like pipes.
* Block devices receive what is written at specific locations which can be retrieved later from the same location; like a file.
* Network devices work with packets rather than bytes (characters or blocks).
	* Not in `/dev`.
	* More advanced than character or block devices.
	* Controlled by `ioctl()` syscall.
* Video adapters write directly to memory of of the video device (because it's faster).
	* Not in `/dev`.

Demo: `/dev/sda1` has a major and minor number that the kernel uses to make the system calls - in this case `8:1`. The kernel uses the major number to determine the type of the device;  major `8` yields `sd` (device type), minor `1` yields information sent to the device driver itself.
