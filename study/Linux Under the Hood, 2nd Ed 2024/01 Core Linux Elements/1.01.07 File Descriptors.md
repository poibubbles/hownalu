* Device access happens through device files.
* Pipes happen through temporary files created in the operating system.
* File descriptors used by processes to keep a list of open files.
* Processes have at least 3 file descriptors:
	* 0:STDIN standard input/keyboard
	* 1:STDOUT standard output/monitor or `/dev/null` for daemons
	* 2:STDERR standard error
* `/proc/<PID>/fd` lists all file descriptors.
* `lsof` gives an interpreted list of the file descriptors.

Demo: `ps aus | grep firef`, `cd /proc/3823/fd`, `ls -l`, `lsof --help`, `lsof -p 3823`.
