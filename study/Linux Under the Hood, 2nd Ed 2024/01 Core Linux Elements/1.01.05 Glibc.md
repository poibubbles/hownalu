Glibc (GNU C Library) or libc (other implementations, ex. for embedded systems)

* Implements C standard library, with standard functions for C programs.
* `open()`, `read()`, `write()`, `malloc()`, `printf()`, etc.
* All program files in Linux have it as a dependency.
* Glibc is released under the GPL.

Demo: `ldd $(which ls)`reveals `libc.so.6`. And lots of other executables.
