* `UID 0` has all capabilities
* Capabilities were introduced to provide granular access to different parts of the operating system.
* `/etc/passwd` assigns UID 0 to root user
* `UID 0` does not depend on `/etc/passwd`, `UID 0` persists in absence of `/etc/passwd`.

	* `touch /.autorelabel` to reset/repair SELinux state.
	* `exec /usr/lib/systemd/systemd` starts `systemd` in the regular way.
