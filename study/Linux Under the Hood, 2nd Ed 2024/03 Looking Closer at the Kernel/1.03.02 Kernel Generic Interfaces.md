* Kernel doesn't like specific drivers.
* The access specific hardware devices, the kernel uses kernel modules as drivers.
* To access modules, generic interfaces are used:
	* Virtual Memory for addressing memory
	* Virtual File System (VFS) for addressing file systems
	* Device Mapper for addressing several types of block devices
	* TCP/IP for addressing network devices
* System calls provide access to these generic interfaces.
* [[sysfs]] and [[procfs]] used to tweak the generic interfaces.


user-level process > read(), write() syscall > file descriptor > VFS > XFS > block device > hardware storage

[[sysfs]] and [[procfs]] are pseudo-filesystems.
