* Useful files in `/proc`:
	* `cpuinfo`
		* See `address_sizes` to get a sense of memory management.
	* `meminfo`
		* See [[3.09.01 Linux Memory Allocation Virtual vs. Physical Memory]] and others.
	* `cmdline` current kernel boot command issued by GRUB
	* `vmstat` stats about current memory usage
	* `modules` kernel modules and their dependencies; `lsmod` is generally nicer
	* `filesystems`currently loaded filesystem drivers
		* `nodev` entries are pseudo filesystems, everything else is real
	* `devices` block and character devices and their major
		* See [[1.05.01 Understanding Device Nodes]] and others.
	* `swaps` swap devices currently in use
		* Maybe use `swapon -a`.
		* Or if `swapon` fails due to missing `/etc/fstab`, inspect `swaps`.
	* `mounts` mounted filesystems
		* Also provided as `/etc/mtab`, but `/proc/mounts` is closer to the running reality.

If you think you're having trouble getting info from normal files in `/etc`, check its friends in `/proc`. Resolve from there.
