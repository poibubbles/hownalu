* Every running process has a `/proc/PID` entry.
* [[ps]], [[lsof]], and [[top]] are common frontend utilities to read `/proc/PID` info.
* `ls -l /proc/PID/fd/*`  shows which file descriptors point to which devices
* `ls -l /proc/PID/ns/*`  shows namespaces (isolated environments) see [[4.13.01 Running an Application on Linux]] and others
* `ls -l /proc/PID/[stat,status]/*`  ugly and pretty status info
